This is the Github repo for out project, so we can collaborate and shit, assuming we decide to use github for this.

In case you dont know how to use Github, I can tell you the following:
I have no idea what I'm doing either!!!

That being said, I have figured out that, to update the files within your own laptop, you can commit them to a branch using the github desktop application. If you want to push those same updates to the github server hosted at github.com rather than only have those changes on your own device, you need to hit the sync button in the top right corner and it will update that webpage and change everything for everyone. Thats about all I know for now.

Verion numbers: vxxx.yyy.zzz
Small changes mean an increment in zzz
Medium changes mean an increment in yyy
Large changes mean an increment in xxx

Github branches:

Use github branches so that we can all make our own edits or changes, branches can be merged later. Im honetly not sure what this branch stuff is about, but i think thats how it works.

Master branch should be the main branch or project that we work off of. Eventually, the goal should be to turn in all the files that are within the masterbranch, so all work must eventually be saved back to that master branch.
