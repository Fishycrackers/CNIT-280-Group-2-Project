Github branches:

Use github branches so that we can all make our own edits or changes, branches can be merged later. Im honetly not sure what this branch stuff is about, but i think thats how it works.

Master branch should be the main branch or project that we work off of. Eventually, the goal should be to turn in all the files that are within the masterbranch, so all work must eventually be saved back to that master branch.
